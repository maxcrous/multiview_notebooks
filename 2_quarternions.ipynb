PnP refers to the process of estimating the pose of a calibrated camera given a set of $n$ 3D points in the world and their corresponding 2D projections in an image.   \n",

You want to find a camera pose such that these rays intersect with their respective world points. The error between the current and optimal pose is quantified by the reprojection error. The reprojection error measures the in-image distance between the pixel point in the provided image, and the pixel point from the projected 3D world point. The projected 3D world point is calculated using the estimated camera pose and known 3D world point coordinate.\n",

The [Levenberg-Marquardt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenberg%E2%80%93Marquardt_algorithm) optimization algorithm is well suited for this. It iteratively minimizes errors by combining a [gradient descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent) solution and a [least-squares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_squares) solution. In other words, it finds the derivative of the squared reprojection error w.r.t the camera pose, and combines two solutions: \n",
    "* Gradient descent - Update the camera in the parameter direction that **reduces** the error.    \n",
    "* Least-squares - Update the camera to the parameter location that **minimizes** the error.      \n",
    "\n",
    "These two solutions model the reprojection error in different ways.    \n",
    "\n",
    "* Gradient descent - Assumes the squared error w.r.t parameters lie on a manifold. A manifold is a mathematical space that is not necessarily Euclidean on a global scale, but can be seen as Euclidean on a local scale. That is, gradients are valid indicators of directions that decrease errors at a local scale.\n",
    "* Least-squares - Assumes the squared error w.r.t parameters is modeled by a convex quadratic polynomial. Like in high school maths, this function is minimized by setting the derivative to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes gradient descent slow but stable and least-squares faster but more erratic. Least-squares makes more assumptions that can be false. The dampening factor $\\lambda$ is the parameter that controls the weight of each solution. When $\\lambda=0$, only the least-squares solution is used, and it is essentially [Gauss-Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%E2%80%93Newton_algorithm) optimization. For greater values of $\\lambda=0$, the gradient descent determines a larger portion of the update. The code implements the equations in the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenberg%E2%80%93Marquardt_algorithm).  "
